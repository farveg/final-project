In this project we are pursuing the question of whether or not prepared speech has greater lexical richness than spontaneous speech. Our speech samples are collected from the Switchboard Corpus (spontaneous, at times prompted, speech) and the C-Span Inaugral Corpus (planned speech).
We will be using TTR and word frequency statistics to measure lexical richness.
